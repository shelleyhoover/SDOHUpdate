Using County Health Rankings data because it best matches (but not perfectly) data of ACS data used for SDOH analysis.    (Ie – 2023 County Health Ranking Data uses 2017-2021 whereas 2025 uses 2020-2022) 

•	Years of potential life lost before age 75 per 100,000 population (age-adjusted) What it is Premature Death is the years of potential life lost before age 75 (YPLL-75). Every death occurring before the age of 75 contributes to the total number of years of potential life lost. For example, a person dying at age 25 contributes 50 years of life lost to a county’s YPLL, whereas a person who dies at age 65 contributes 10 years of life. The YPLL measure is presented as a rate per 100,000 population and is age-adjusted to the 2000 US population
